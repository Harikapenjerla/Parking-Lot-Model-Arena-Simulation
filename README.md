# Project Title: Parking Lot Models Using ARENA Simulation

## Highlights of the project
1. Scenario: Busy parking lot system of the university. <br />
2. Designed an animated simulation model for two design models using ARENA simulation tool. <br />
3. Compared both models result with utilization of model 1 as 65% and another model as 75%. <br />
4. Using this prototype, we can add more real world options like parking meters, handicapped parking etc. <br />
